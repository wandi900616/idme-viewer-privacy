        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated: February 27, 2026</strong></p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how our application (“the App”) collects, uses, and protects user information. This App is designed as a productivity tool for educators to access external portals via an optimized WebView interface.</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>The App collects specific data types to enable its core features. We are committed to transparency regarding how this data is handled.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>A. User-Provided Information (Account Credentials)</strong><br>
            To enable automated login and navigation within the teacher portal, the App collects:
            <ul>
                <li>User IDs (Usernames or Email addresses)</li>
                <li>Passwords</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Security:</strong> This data is stored locally on your device using Android’s <code>EncryptedSharedPreferences</code> (AES-256 encryption). It is never transmitted to the developer’s servers. It is used exclusively to facilitate the login process between your device and the official portal.
        </div>

        <strong>B. Automated Collection (Service Providers)</strong>
        <p>The App integrates the Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) SDK, which automatically collects certain data for advertising and analytics purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device Identifiers (Advertising ID)</li>
            <li>App Performance data (Crash logs and diagnostics)</li>
            <li>App interactions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. WebView and Third-Party Content</h2>
        <p>The App displays content from official educational websites via an embedded WebView. All login actions and data interactions occur directly between the user and the official website. The App does not intercept or record credentials beyond the automation steps explicitly requested by the user.</p>

        <h2>3. Advertising</h2>
        <p>We use Google AdMob to display rewarded advertisements. Google processes data in accordance with its own privacy policy. You can learn more here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy & Terms</a>.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>The App utilizes the <code>androidx.security:security-crypto</code> library. This ensures that any sensitive data stored at rest is protected by industry-standard encryption, preventing other applications on the device from accessing your credentials.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Deletion and Retention</h2>
        <p><strong>Users maintain full control over their data:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Deletion:</strong> You can permanently delete your stored User ID and Password at any time by clicking the <strong>"Logout"</strong> button within the App menu. This immediately wipes the encrypted storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Uninstallation:</strong> Uninstalling the App or clearing the App storage via Android System Settings will also remove all locally stored data.</li>
            <li><strong>External Data:</strong> Since we do not store your data on external servers, we do not maintain copies of your credentials once deleted from your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>This App is intended for professional use by educators and is not intended for individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact the developer via the contact information provided on the Google Play Store listing.</p>
